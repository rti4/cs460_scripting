<meta http-equiv="content-type" content="text/html; charset=ISO-8859-1"></head><body>This homework will give you practice with html forms. It starts with some
warm-up exercises and then has a bigger problem at the end that makes you
combine your skills with the different form elements. A couple general
notes:
<p>
</p><ol>
<li> Please create a separate html file for each of the four homework
	questions.
</li><li> Please use the <tt>label</tt> element to label all widgets. 
     I do not care whether you use the explicit or implicit type of label.
</li><li> Please select appropriate values for the name/value attributes of your
     widgets. The TAs will check that they are there but will not be grading
     them unless you choose completely inappropriate values.
</li></ol>
<p>
</p><hr>
<ol>
<li> Create a menu with the following characteristics:
     <ol>
     <li> It has the elements "United States", "Albania", "Britain", "Canada",
          "China", "France", "Germany", "India", "Italy", and "Mexico"
     </li><li> It displays 6 elements at a time
     </li><li> It allows multiple selections
     </li><li> China is the initial, default selection
     </li></ol>
<p>
</p></li><li> Redo the above menu so that it has the categories "North America",
     "Europe", and "Asia". Put the countries in the obvious places (India should
     be placed in "Asia").
<p>
</p></li><li> Create a html file that builds the form shown below:
     <p>
     </p><center><img src="hw2_files/radio.jpg"></center>
     <p>
     You will need to use a table to do the visual formatting. The structural
     characteristics of the form are as follows:
     </p><p>
     </p><ol>
     <li> 1 is the default selection
     </li><li> The textbox widget and the <tt>other</tt> radio button should appear
          together.
     </li><li> The submit button uses the <tt>get</tt> method for posting. You can
          use "foo.php" as the name of your script, even though it will not
	  work.
     </li></ol>
     <p>
     The visual formatting characteristics are as follows:
     </p><p>
     </p><ol>
     <li> The radio buttons are left-aligned with a <tt>2em</tt> left padding
          in front of each radio button
     </li><li> The radio buttons should be laid out in a 2x3 grid.
     </li><li> There are two non-breaking spaces between the <tt>other</tt> radio
          button and its textbox
     </li><li> The <tt>Number of Dependents</tt> label will also appear in the 
          table but should not have a <tt>2em</tt> left padding (hint: if you
	  use style sheets to create the <tt>2em</tt> left padding then you
	  may need to use a class attribute to override the left padding for
	  the <tt>Number of Dependents</tt> column.
     </li></ol>
<p>
</p></li><li> Create a html file that builds the hotel form shown below:
     <p>
     </p><center><img src="hw2_files/hotel.jpg"></center>
     <br clear="all">
     Choose appropriate values for the names and value attributes of each
     of the widgets.
     The form has the following structural characteristics:
     <p>
     </p><ol>
     <li> There are three groupings for "Hotel Finder", "Room Information",
          and "Special Needs". Each of these groupings should be labeled as
	  shown in the figure.
     </li><li> Country menu: It should contain three countries: "United States", 
          "Mexico", and "Canada".
     </li><li> City: Its size should be 10 characters with a maximum length of 15
          characters
     </li><li> State: It should contain four states, "Kentucky", "Ohio", "Tennessee",
           and "Wyoming"
     </li><li> Check-in Date: 
          <p>
	  </p><ul> 
	  <li> The default value should be "mm/dd/yyyy". 
	  </li><li> The size and maximum length should both be 10 characters
	  </li></ul>
	  <p>
     </p></li><li> Check-out Date: Same as Check-in Date
     </li><li> Number of People: "1" should be the default selection
     </li><li> Amenities: Theres should be no default selection
     </li><li> Room Type: "Double" should be the default selection
     </li><li> Special Needs: Use a text area that is 5 rows and 50 characters wide.
     </li></ol>
     <p>
     The form has the following visual formatting characteristics:
     </p><p>
     </p><ol>
     <li> Labels: Use the <tt>label</tt> element for all labels.
     </li><li> Hotel Finder: Use a table to format the widgets and labels
          <ul>
          <li> "Country"/"City" labels should be left-aligned
	  </li><li> "Check-in Date"/"Check-Out Date"/"Number of People" labels
               should be left-aligned.
	  </li><li> The text widgets for "Check-In Date" and "Check-Out Date" should be
               below their labels.
          </li></ul>
     </li><li> Room Information: Use a table to format the widgets and labels
     	  and make the width of the table be 400 pixels.
          <ul>
	  <li> The "Amenities" column should get 60% of the width and the
	       "Room Type" column should get 40% of the width of the table.
          </li><li> The checkboxes for "Amenities" should be centered vertically with 
                respect to the radio buttons and checkbox for "Room Type".
          </li><li> The "Smoking" checkbox should have 15 pixels of vertical separation
               from the radio buttons above it.
	  </li></ul>
	  <p>
	  <b>An important thing to note about this table is that your browser
	  	may appear to assign much more space to the room type than 40%
		of the table. If you set the border attribute of the table to
		1 as a debugging aid, then you will see what has happened.
		The table is the right width and the right amount of space has
		been allocated to its two columns. However, your browser may
		make the form's width equal the browser window's width. Since
		no border is being placed around the table, but a border is
		being placed around the fieldset element, the viewer gets the
		impression that the browser has allocated much more space to
		room type than it really has.</b>
		</p><p>
     </p></li><li> Special Needs: No special formatting instructions.
    </li></ol>
    <p>
    Finally the form has the following tab order:
    </p><p>
    </p><ol>
    <li> Country
    </li><li> City
    </li><li> Check-in Date
    </li><li> Check-out Date
    </li><li> Special Needs
    </li></ol>
    Do not worry about the tab order for the radio button or checkbox 
    groups.
