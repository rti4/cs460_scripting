<h3> Problems </h3>

<li> (<b>40 points</b>) The following XPath queries should be performed on an XML file with
     the following structure:
  	<xmp>
	&lt;catalog&gt;
	  &lt;artist&gt;* 
	    &lt;retired&gt; 
	    &lt;country&gt; 
	    &lt;name&gt;
	      &lt;first&gt; 
	      &lt;last&gt; 
	    &lt;/name&gt;
	    &lt;cd&gt;*
	      &lt;title&gt; 
	      &lt;company&gt; 
	      &lt;price&gt; 
	      &lt;yearReleased&gt; 
	      &lt;dateAcquired&gt; 
	</xmp>
     <a href="http://www.cs.utk.edu/%7Ebvz/cs460/hw/hw5/cd2catalog.html">cdcatalog</a> 
     contains an example XML file that satisfies this XML structure.
<p>
      </p><ol>
      <li> Write an XPath expression that locates all price elements in the
	   XML file with a value of 23.
      </li><li> Write an XPath expression that locates the third artist element
           (use the W3C standard, not the Internet Explorer standard)
      </li><li> Write an XPath expression that locates all name elements, no
	   matter where they appear in the XML file.
      </li><li> Write an XPath expression that locates the last cd element in
	   each artist element.
      </li><li> Write an XPath expression that assumes you start at a <b>cd</b>
	   node and that locates name elements whose last name is
	   <tt>Mouse</tt>.
      </li></ol>

</p></li><li> <b>(60 points)</b> Design an XML file to structure the data for the following human
	resource application for Brad's Musical Works. 
	The file will be a list of employee records.
	Each employee record should contain the employee's name, spouse's
	name, and any children's names (first, middle,
	and last in all cases). Each record should also contain the
	employee's social security number, salary, and date of birth (month,
	day, year). Finally the record should contain the employee's
	job title, which can be either manager or staff. If the
	employee's job title is manager, then there should be additional
	information that contains the number of years the employee has
	been a manager and the name of the group that the manager heads.
	If the employee's job title is staff, then there should be
	additional information about the types of skills the employee
	possesses (e.g., clerical, musical, bookkeeping, sales). An
	employee may have one or more skills.
	<p>
	Your solution should show me the hierarchy of element tags you will
	use. Place an asterisk (*), plus (+), or question mark (?) next to
	an element if it can occur 0 or more times, 1 or more times, or 0/1
	times respectively. If you require one of two elements, you can
	write <tt>&lt;element1&gt; | &lt;element2&gt;</tt> and use the
	following syntax: 
	<xmp>
	&lt;element1&gt; | &lt;element2&gt;
	  &lt;element1&gt;
	    ...
	  &lt;element2&gt;
	    ...
	</xmp>

	<b>Hints</b>: 
	</p><ol>
	<li> Only use attributes if you want points deducted.
	</li><li> Use the format shown in the previous problem to write your
		XML specification.

<h3>What to Submit</h3>
<p>
You should use the same submission script you have used thus far this 
semester and you should name your files as follows:
</p><p>
Question 1: xpath.txt (just a plain-text file with the answers)<br>
Question 2: employee.txt (just a plain-text file with the answers)
